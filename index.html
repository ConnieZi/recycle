            <h1>Welcome to Recycle Passport!</h1>
            <p1>
              There exist multiple different ways to recycle plastic, cardboard, paper, and aluminum materials and recycle laws and methods are different based on a person’s location. We propose a social website where a person has their own “Recycle Passport.” The “About Me” section features a person’s name, location, and short introduction. The user is able to look at how to recycle based on their city’s current location. They can look at how to recycle specific materials based on where they are located. If the user is traveling, they are able to save a “trip” which will allow them to view recycle rules in the location where they are planning to go. Every little difference counts, and this is a useful tool for anyone who is interested in making small recycling changes that add up over time! Moreover, we implemented an option to be able to link the user’s social media accounts so that they can share on how many trips they recycled.
