            <h1>About us</h1>
            <p1>
                64% of material is recycled in Germany! This means that 64% of their waste
                is kept OUT of landfills!
                <br>
                Recycling rules differ based on country and city. We have established a website
                where a person is able to build a "recycling passport" of places that they have
                recycled materials.
                <br>
                If a person is traveling to Berlin, then they might want to make sure that they
                are recycling their materials correctly. In our website, the user would be
                able to add in a "trip" to Berlin and they would be presented with ways to
                recycle different materials.
              <br>
                Moreover, if a user is unsure of how to recycle a specific material, they
                will be able to search up the material to make sure that they are able to recycle
                it correctly.
              <br>
                One future idea that could branch off of this would be the creation of a recycling
                app where a user would connect their RecyclePassport profile to their cell phone. The
                user would answer specific questions about a material and get an answer on how to recycle
                it. For example, different types of plastics are able to be recycled in different ways.
                In the United States, this is able to be seen on the bottom of plastic containers.
                containers are labeled with a triangle and number which describes the material.
